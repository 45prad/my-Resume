As an Assistant Professor at C10 Educare, my role was to provide high-quality
education to 11th and 12th-grade science students, preparing them for
competitive entrance exams such as JEE, MHTCET, NEET, BITSAT, and more.
In addition to classroom teaching, I also managed a YouTube channel for the

It was a rewarding experience to guide and support students in their educational
journey, helping them achieve their goals and unlocking their full potential.
